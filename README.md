Project Overview

This project is a real-time temperature monitoring system built using Arduino Uno, a TMP36 temperature sensor, a 16x2 LCD display, and a buzzer 
for alerts. It continuously measures temperature, displays readings on an LCD screen, and triggers an alarm if the temperature exceeds a predefined
threshold. The system was designed, tested, and simulated using TinkerCAD.

Tools & Technologies Used

Arduino Uno – Microcontroller for processing data.

TMP36 Temperature Sensor – Used for temperature measurement.

16x2 LCD Display – Displays real-time temperature readings.

Buzzer – Provides an alert if temperature crosses the threshold.

TinkerCAD – Used for circuit simulation and validation.

Arduino IDE – For coding and uploading the program.

Features

✔️ Real-time temperature monitoring.
✔️ LCD display for easy visibility of temperature data.
✔️ Buzzer alert system for high-temperature warning.
✔️ Simulated and tested in TinkerCAD to ensure reliability.
✔️ Simple and cost-effective implementation.

The system consists of:

TMP36 Sensor connected to Arduino for temperature readings.

16x2 LCD to display the current temperature.

Buzzer to provide alerts.

Arduino Uno for processing and handling input/output operations.

How It Works

The TMP36 sensor detects the temperature and sends analog data to the Arduino Uno.

The Arduino processes the data and converts it into a readable format.

The LCD display shows the real-time temperature.

If the temperature crosses a set threshold, the buzzer sounds an alert.

The system can be tested and modified using TinkerCAD before real-world implementation.

Simulation

The project has been simulated and tested using TinkerCAD to validate circuit design and functionality.

Future Enhancements

WiFi Connectivity: Send temperature data to a remote server.

Mobile App Integration: View real-time data on a smartphone.

Data Logging: Store historical temperature data for analysis.
